# Sentimental-Analysis-
Natural Language Processing for Submissions.csv

For this assignment I had used a dataset containing 3534 Rows, 2 Columns. 

In this assignment as it is a Natural Language Proccessing assignment of twitter dataset I had worked on Sentimental Analysis and gave model predicting wether the given tweet is positive or negative by reviewing the polarity. 

I had used stopwords of google to clean and lemmitization.

After the cleaning of the dataset further I checked the frequency of the words using the wordcloud and then went on perfoming the Bag of Words, Vecotrs for Each Word using TFIDF vectorizer and Word2Vec.
